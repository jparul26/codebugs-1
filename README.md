<h1>Codefundo++ 2019 Project</h1>
The web application developed by the team helps citizens of a country to smoothly and quickly register as voters, and cast thier vote in a tamper-proof secure way by using azure blockchain.

The web app has two basic functionalities:-

1. Voter Registration.
	 The data entered by the voter is first verified by the smart contract and then added to the 	voter list of the correct constituency.
   
2. Voting Portal
	 Voter belonging to respective constituency will be allowed to cast a vote only after providing a valid pre-registered ID.

Both these functionalities make use of Azure Blockchain through smart contracts.

The project aims to:
1. Speed up the process of registering as a voter.
2. Make the voters list tamperproof.
3. Allow eligible voters to vote remotely.
4. Use of Azure Blockchain to make the system secure
5. Quickly decalre results of an election after it ends
